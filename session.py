# Write a program to calculate the GST tax of two products, apple and pie
# Apple has 10% GST and pie has 8%
# Calculate total GST that need to be deducted from the bill
# Apple gross sale is $75, pie gross is $100

apple_gross = 75
pie_gross = 100
total_gst = (apple_gross/100*10) + (pie_gross/100*8)

# Write a program to calculate the number of minis in the maxis
# Total maxis s 2.5*minis
# 1 mini is 5000
# Calculate how much is 4.5 maxis

value for minis is 5000
maxis is 2.5*minis
so 4.5 maxis is equal to 2.5*4.5*minis
display maxis

minis = 5000
maxis = 2.5*minis
print("value of maxis is :",4.5*maxis)
